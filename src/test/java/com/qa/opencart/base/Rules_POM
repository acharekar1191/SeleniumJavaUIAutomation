Golden Rules for POM (Memorize these)
🔑 Rule 1

BaseTest initializes only the landing page

🔑 Rule 2

Navigation methods return the next page

🔑 Rule 3

Tests should NEVER do new Page() directly

🔑 Rule 4

Page existence = user navigation, not object creation

Real Interview Answer

“We initialize only the entry page in BaseTest. All other page objects are returned via 
navigation methods to ensure correct page state, lazy loading, and maintainable test flow.”
